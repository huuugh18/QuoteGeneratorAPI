# QuoteGeneratorAPI

This is my very simple Flask based Quote Generator API.

This is an application that serves different author quotes. The quotes, at this moment, must be stored in a .json file. This is not a new idea, I made it for educational popuses. 

Features:
=========
* Serves random quotes, each quote has its author and a identification number.
* Serves all the quotes said by a certain author
* Serves quotes by its identification number 

Installation:
=============
